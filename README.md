# My Personal MQL5 Backup Folder

This repository serves as a personal backup for my MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) scripts, indicators, experts, and other trading-related files. It's intended to keep all my custom MQL5 development work organized, versioned, and easily accessible across devices.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This folder is primarily for personal use and may contain experimental or unfinished code.
